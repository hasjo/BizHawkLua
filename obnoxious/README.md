# The Obnoxious Script for BizHawk

## What's this do?

This script makes it so that every so often (by default between 5-30 seconds) either a state will be saved or loaded.
The idea is that at random you could lose the last 5-30 seconds of progress.
It's designed to be unfun and I think that's the draw of this script.

## How do I start it?

Download obnoxious.lua from this directory and load it into your emulator by going to Tools>Lua Console and then drop the file in or open the script.

## Running the script
The script will start when you press the L button on your controller and you will see "RUNNING" in the bottom left.
To pause running you press L again and it will tell you that it's "NOT RUNNING"
